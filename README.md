# MConsole

v1.1

Dropin in-game developer console

1.1 history works, fpscounter, defaultcommands node added

# Install

place all repo files in /addons/MConsole

drop the addons/MConsole/DropinScene/GameConsole.tscn where you want it.

Also add the FPSCounter.tscn if you want

Note that there should ever only be one COnsoleCommand Node and it comes in that Console scene so depending on how your project
handles scenes it might need to be broken apart and tweaked.

# ToDo
autocomplete, command list, command search
